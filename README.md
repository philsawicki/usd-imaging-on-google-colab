# USD Imaging on Google Colab

Demonstrating usage of the USD Imaging APIs on Google Colab notebooks.

## About
This project demonstrate the use of USD Imaging APIs via Google Colaboratory notebook.

The goal is to make it easy to:
 * Leverage Google Colab's infrastructure to experiment with USD APIs, and render imaging previews;
 * Experiment with [Arnold](https://github.com/Autodesk/arnold-usd)'s Hydra render delegate;
 * etc.
